# Mofily @/Program.cs  with RAG feature: 

[ ] Read Annotations from ssd.json and create embeddings for each DataItemMetaModel with format "Name: {Name} Название: {Title}"
[ ] Implement cosine similarity function to find the most relevant annotation based on user prompt
[ ] Modify @/Program.cs to integrate the RAG feature by adding the found JSON annotation to the user request
[ ] Test the implementation with sample prompts to verify the RAG functionality works correctly
[ ] Document the changes and ensure code quality
